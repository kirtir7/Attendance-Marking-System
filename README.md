# Attendance-Marking-System
This repository contains my project "Attendance Marking System" in which  Feature Hog Descriptor Algorithm has been used to mark attendance of an individual by using face detection. The algorithm recognizes the face of an individual and compares it with the database to mark attendance. Moreover, an attendance record with the details of an individual's attendance with time is also maintained. Additionally, to prevent spoofing and detect the fake faces, liveness detection techniques like blinking of eyes is introduced., and any unrecognized face will be marked as ‘unique’.


A research paper has also been published in IEEE Xplore on this algorithm.
The link of the research paper is: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9753963
This paper was presented by me in 2nd International Conference on Innovative Practices in Technology and Management (ICIPTM) on Apr 18, 2022.
